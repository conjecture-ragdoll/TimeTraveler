(Concept)
An array of functions will contain actions the player will take when confronted by the main NPC.
The player's actions will then recursively traverse through the pointers to functions (Like a Binary Search).
Player's actions affect the future of the game, but if the player is unhappy, player is able to buy his way back to
travel back to the past with player's current experience. If player reaches a leaf node and gets unlucky he could die
but if he respawns to a forgiving future, he could start over and go back to the begining of time with all his points to
score more points.


Actions/ Events in the universe will contain function arrays.
They will be displayed in a Binary Search style algorithm.
User will be confronted with 2 options each time the future proceeds.



C-style language?

function_array1 = {
    ...
    In-Order traversal functions
    ...
}
 
In the common lisp solution, events are added to the equivalent of function_array1 list through binary insertion-sort. To index these events in lisp, the binary search algorithm will be involved. There will be multiple lists like function_array1 to identify parameters in the same timeline for each element.
