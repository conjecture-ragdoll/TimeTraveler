;; for the sake of traversing, we will do
;; binary search to traverse through events.

;; we will reference each event as index
;;            left or right:

;; For now we can visualize indexing with L R references
;;                   root
;;                    |
;;                    |

;;             ^             ^   
;;             |             |
;;      L means left      R means right
